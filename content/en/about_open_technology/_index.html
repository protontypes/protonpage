Protontypes estimates that open and transparent innovation strategies will grow rapidly in industries like, mobility, health, safety, banking, manufacturing or renewable energy. We believe that sustainable and open technologies in combination with professional support finds a critical mass to establish economic platforms.[[0]](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/5-open-source-trends-2020-ossra/) [[0]](https://a16z.com/2019/10/04/commercializing-open-source/) [[1]](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/innovation/company/open-manufacturing-cloud.html) [[2]](https://singularityhub.com/2020/03/02/the-worlds-first-open-source-nuclear-reactor-blueprint-is-coming-online/) [[3]](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/12/how-open-source-software-took-over-the-world/) [[4]](https://www.coronawarn.app/en/) [[5]](https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/18378/banks-are-finally-embracing-the-open-source-movement)

Key technologies in most digital industries are today driven by open tooling and infrastructure. This includes the field of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, high performance computing, robotics, communication technology, operation systems, databases, enterprice infrastructure, security and data analysis. Around 70% of the codebase in software security and risk analysis is open source.

The dominant IT companies owe much of their success to sustained investment in open software tools. These investments created an independent ecosystem for new innovations driving most of the software industry today.

Lost confidence in technology further reinforces this trend leading to open communication solutions to create a complete chain of trust for data processing and communication.

Robotics as a combination of multiple software and hardware domains is also showing this trend with estimated 55% of all shipped robots using the open source framework Robot Operating System (ROS) in 2024.

The knowledge about necessary development tools, strategies and methods was collected over five years based on open technologies in logistic and automotive.
