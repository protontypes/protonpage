  Where can I find support in the application of open technologies?
---

Protontypes acts as a channel for open technologie support. We have good contacts to multiple professional organisation for the open toolsets we advice to use.

Protontypes can be first level support for professional open source applications in your organisation. Our goal is not to replace classical support but to forwards you to the open source companies and organisations that fit to your needs. 

If no longtime support can be archived by the original open source project owner or community we can fill this gab with our experties to achieve long time support.
