The development of innovative software products requires a combination of powerful tools, organisations and methods to create transparent and traceable development environments. Various open source communities and projects provide a variety of sub-functions and solutions. The challenge is to combine the right tools and ensure sufficient support from the community and open source companies over the complete product life cycle. This allows to build powerful, independent and efficient ecosystems for universities and companies to accompany innovative developments from prototypical development to product development.
