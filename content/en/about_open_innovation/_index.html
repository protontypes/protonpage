The key technologies in most digital industries today are driven by open tools and infrastructures. These include artificial intelligence, cloud computing, high-performance computing, robotics, communication technology, operating systems, databases, enterprise infrastructure, security, mapping and data science. About 70% of the code base in software security and risk analysis is open source.

The dominant IT companies owe a large part of their success to sustained investment in open software tools. These investments created an independent ecosystem for new innovations that drive most of the software industry today.

Lost confidence in technology further reinforces this trend leading to open communication solutions to create a complete chain of trust for data processing and communication.

Robotics as a combination of several technical areas also shows this trend. More than half of all robots delivered in 2024 are estimated to use the open source framework Robot Operating System (ROS).
