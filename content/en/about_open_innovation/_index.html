Open and transparent innovation strategies and platforms will dominate new sectors in the coming years. What began within the classic IT company infrastructures can now be observed more and more in many other industries. Read more about how open technologies are finding their way into new industries:

The key technologies in most digital industries today are driven by open tools and infrastructures. These include artificial intelligence, cloud computing, high-performance computing, robotics, communication technology, operating systems, databases, enterprise infrastructure, security, mapping and data science. About 70% of the code base in software security and risk analysis is open source.

The dominant IT companies owe a large part of their success to sustained investment in open software tools. These investments created an independent ecosystem for new innovations that drive most of the software industry today.

Lost confidence in technology further reinforces this trend leading to open communication solutions to create a complete chain of trust for data processing and communication.

Robotics as a combination of several technical areas also shows this trend: An estimated 55% of all robots delivered in 2024 use the open source framework Robot Operating System (ROS). [[1]](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190516005135/en/Rise-ROS-55-total-commercial-robots-shipped) 

The Autonomous Logistics Department at the DHL Innovation Center in Aachen showed that sustainable product development based on largely open tools and methods can be achieved with a small team of inexperienced engineers.  This is possible because most of the software tools and algorithms for building powerful products in robotics are freely available today. The knowledge about necessary development tools, strategies and methods from different robotics, logistics and automotive applications has been built on the giant shoulder of open technologies.
