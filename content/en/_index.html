protontypes is an open community for the acceleration of open projects, [business models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_models_for_open-source_software), technologies and platforms. We create tools for the financing, marketing, and development of liberated innovations. Our community is open to everyone who believes in the innovative power of [Standing on the Shoulder of Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants). 

*Our aim is to accelerate open and independent innovation with a sustainable impact.*    
Especially in the development of an low-carbon economy, we need to be fast and efficient. [By spreading knowledge](https://github.com/protontypes/awesome-sustainable-technology) in this domain with open software, design, standards, tools, and platforms a sustainable economy can be reached in a short timespan.
